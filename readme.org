* Basics
This is my NixOS/nix-darwin configuration. It is not the prettiest you'll ever see, but it works for me. I am specifically avoiding home-manager for the sake of eval times.

One of my flake outputs builds a live iso, this uses hjem to copy some dotfiles into place. My neovim configuration is generated using NVF. Big thanks to NotAShelf for maintaining both of these projects.

* Directories explained
~hosts/~: Configurations for individual machines. Most of the things in here are either deployment specific, or trivial enough I don't feel like splitting it into a module.

~hosts/hw~: Hardware configuration, largely automatically generated.

~modules/common~: Modules shared by multiple machines, sometimes on multiple platforms.

~modules/darwin~: Darwin-specific modules. Pretty barebones because I strongly prefer Linux.

~modules/svc~: Modules that define and configure services. Trivial service definitions are generally left inside host configurations.

~modules/sys~: Modules that demand system level functionality changes. Invasive or resource-intensive services may be found here, as well as lower level configuration changes.

~modules/desktop~: Graphical, desktop-oriented functionality.

~modules/pkgs~: Loosely-organized sets of programs to install from nixpkgs.

~dots/~: Non-nix dotfiles to copy into an iso file.

~users/~: Defines user accounts
