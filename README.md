Welcome to my (shitty) Nix configuration!

Here's a handy guide:

bak: old configs I'm keeping around just in case

common: stuff that's shared by multiple machines

pkgs: package collections, currently a mess

hosts: configurations for individual machines

modules: things that are too large or too complex to include in other files, also often shared

home: home manager configuration I may or may not use
