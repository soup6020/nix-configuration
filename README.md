Welcome to my (shitty) Nix configuration!
Here's a handy guide:
bak: old configs I'm keeping around just in case
common: stuff that's shared by multiple machines
darwin: macOS specific stuff
kvm: configurations for my current KVM virtual machine
pkgs: package collections, currently a mess
wendigo: what will eventually become my desktop system's configuration
